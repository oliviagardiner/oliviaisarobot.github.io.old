summary: 'This book really put me on the emotional rollercoaster, with a lineup of very unlikeable characters and a horrifying story that slowly builds into a brutally honest confession. Terrible mistakes have been made, and the price is equally terrible.'

*This review was originally written for [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1638108524).*

I still have mixed feelings about this novel. The first half of it was a real pain to read, and I am not usually one to struggle with books. In the first half, you see the world through the eyes of an extremely selfish and vain woman, who became a mother for all the wrong reasons. I enjoyed very little the whiny way she remembered her youth and her first pregnancy - with Kevin.

She was near paranoid, almost ever since the moment Kevin conceived, that this child was out to ruin her life. She's always found it a huge trouble and an insane sacrifice to change her routine and her habits. She was self-entitled and extremely judgmental if not insensitive. Even her relationship seemed to be all about her.

The second half of the story was significantly darker. It was more obvious than before, that this is the memoir of a woman who has many regrets, and every word is written with non-forgiving self-despise. I could tell Eva was sorry for many things she has done, and selfish as she was, I never doubted that she did love Franklin.
I couldn't sympathize with her.

Oddly enough, I could understand Kevin more. Not his personality, which to me was almost fictional. I understand the reason behind his existence. It was almost some kind of a force to counter Eva's selfish and careless self, Kevin was her dark side, a mirror that put all her ignorance and indifference on display. Kevin represented all the destruction happening in the world, but on a smaller scale.

His perspective was really dark, a careless life that never had to suffer any kind of shortage, a spoiled but very critical child who regarded every move of the world with skepticism. To him, the world held no more secrets, everything has been done before, everything has been discovered, created, and he was just not needed to keep it going. He was unneeded, and where the rest saw conventional values Kevin saw shallow compromises.
He was also a bit like her mother. He too seemed to be looking for something undefined, something extraordinary, that just never happened, and it left them both dissatisfied.

In the end I felt an overwhelming sympathy for the rest of Kevin's and Eva's family. Through the second part of the book, I watched Eva succumb to Kevin's dark view of the world, a world where everything has already been achieved, and in a world like that, all that was left to do was to destroy it, just like it was built - brick by brick.
