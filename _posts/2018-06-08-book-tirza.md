*This review was originally written for [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2460580957).*

This reading experience was a true rollercoaster, between the heights of the exceptional writing style and masterful storytelling, and the lows of having to follow this obsessive, conflicted anti-hero through the most uncomfortable and repulsive details of his personality, and his life.

The plot twist is well crafted and surprising, anything but predictable. What makes it a difficult read, is the fact that not only I couldn't sympathize with the main character at all, in fact, I found it hard to relate to any of the characters in the book, but I also had to suffer through every awkward, uncomfortable, or sometimes straight-out disturbing depiction of sexuality. I welcome the fact, that Grunberg was not trying to over-romanticize sexuality (something that happens way too often, just to entertain the reader), and I am also willing to settle for the argument that this plain, instinct-driven way is how psychopaths think about sexuality, it was nonetheless disturbing and uncomfortable.

To me, it was a very dissatisfying read, simply because I didn't get the message that Grunberg was so cleverly trying to put together. Surely, the plot twist changed the entire genre of the book, and ever since I've first read Lionel Shriver's work, I learned to appreciate, how hard it must be to write a main character that every reader is going to hate. In Lionel Shriver's case, it was worth suffering through the despicable actions of a completely unlikable character, in this case however, I'm not so sure.

If you've ever watched a movie or read a book and wondered, what the whole story could've been like from the villain's point of view, this novel might be for you. Otherwise, save yourself the trauma.
