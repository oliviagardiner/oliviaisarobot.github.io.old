summary: "It may not be a big surprise that I am huge fan of the Millennium Trilogy. When I heard that someone else picked up Larsson's legacy to continue the story, I was intrigued and terrified, so much that I just had to read it."

*This review was originally written for [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1638066538).*

When I started reading this book I had my doubts and high expectations. I thought that a story shouldn't really have a sequel after the author's died. Some stories are bigger than the author himself, but Blomkvist and Salander WAS Larsson's story. I acknowledge Lagercrantz's attempts to get into the characters' heads, and I was really ready to be forgiving, because it must be very hard to follow the footsteps of a successful author, and get into his style of storytelling.

The first "disappointment" to me was the fact that after the third book, I imagined the characters development very differently. This book states that several years have passed since the third book's events (doesn't specify how many), but in many way the characters behave like it was yesterday, and it seems they haven't progressed much ever since.

It starts out with interesting prospects, such as the challenges of how an old school investigative reporter would adapt to the modern world of social media, and then... the whole idea just ends up under the rug and the story takes a completely different turn.
Balder's character is interesting but his research is very vaguely described, the concept of AI is casually addressed, without trying to discuss anything really meaningful about it. The parts about autism and savants is also very sketchily written, and through the book I kept wondering, is Lagercrantz afraid to go really in-depth about anything?

Mikael Blomkvist is straight-out useless in this one, his "story of the century" is basically handed to him, without him playing any real part. His previous relationship from the third book, with Sapo investigator Monica Figuerola remains undiscussed, and we learn nothing about his personal life, apart from the fact that he is in a sort of midlife crisis and an art block, when he feels like time has passed him by as a journalist.

Lisbeth Salander is awkwardly written in this one, and I don't mean the usual Lisbeth kind of awkwardness either. On several occasions, it feels like her reaction is out of place, or more emotional than calculating (before, it was the other way round). It bothers me to an extent that in all those years that have passed since the third book, he found no real goal in her life, apart from trying to track down the remnants of his father's criminal empire. Okay... but Lisbeth Salander was the woman who hated men who hated women. It would be logical (maybe only to me?) that she would devote her time to exposing such men, and become some sort of an anonymous online vigilante. It would really suit her.

Female characters suffer in this book dearly. While before we had Harriet Vanger's horrifying tale, Erika Berger's ambitious spin-offs, and an army of powerful female supports like Sonja Modig, Monica Figuerola, Annika Giannini or Susanne Linder. In this, we have the good-for-nothing ex Mrs. Balder, Sapo investigator Gabriella Grane who doesn't really do anything either, except for feeling sorry for not being able to protect Prof. Balder, Alone Casales with the constant lesbian undertone and of course Camilla Salander. We learn nothing about their lives or their personality and very little about their motives.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that for a change, we were able to avert from Larsson's feminist-tuned nasty-guys and holy-girls concept, and I welcome having a woman as the "bad guy", and I also welcome the fact that not every man is a pig.

To continue on with the positives, Lagercrantz did create some interesting characters, such as Jan Holtser and of course Prof. Balder himself.

The undeniable worst moment of the book for me was when once again Holger Palmgren appeared to clarify everything we wanted to know about Camilla Salander, and confirm that she was behind the series of crimes Lisbeth is investigating. To me, Camilla Salander's involvement was painfully expectable, and it didn't surprise me the least, therefore I can't really name any real "turns" in the plot, that would have made it particularly interesting for me to read.

In the end we are left with Blomkvist's new story of the century, Millennium saved from bankruptcy again, some bad guys arrested, NSA scandal revealed. And of course the main antagonist got away to make room for another sequel, which I'm really not sure I'm going to read.
