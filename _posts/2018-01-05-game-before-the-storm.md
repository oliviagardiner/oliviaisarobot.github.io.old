## Thoughts

I bought this game a while back, but I didn't get around playing it until now.

I was looking forward to playing this game. I whole-heartedly loved Life is Strange, so when I heard this was available, I bought it immediately, driven by the strong impact the first game had on me. I loved the immersive, magical, trippy nature of the game, and I really liked Chloe. She was now our main character, so this has to be good, right? Right?

Spoilers ahead!

At first sight, this game is doing okay making you believe you are playing Life is Strange. **It's got a pleasant soundtrack, the same familiar interface**, and - wait Chloe was making the exact same kind of journal Max was? That's cute, I suppose. Then there is Chloe Price, our dear troubled Chloe, and we got Arcadia Bay, the virtual synonym for Bumblefuck. What's that Unity logo at the startup? Oh, nevermind, it's Life is Strange!

I desperately wanted to like this game. The mechanics were the same as in the first one, except for the time travelling aspect of course. Chloe's "superpower" is eh, I guess, arguing? Instead of taking photos, we got tagging and graffiti in this. Armed with our new skills we are allowed to explore the prequels **and get to know a little more about Chloe's life and her relationship with the mysterious Rachel Amber.**

First, let's talk about what I liked about this game.

I think the music, for the most part, was interesting and fitting. I was also cool with the voice acting. And well... that's about it.

As I played more and more I couldn't shake this feeling that something was off. I often noticed that the movement of the characters, the way they were animated looked odd. Has it always been like that? I was moving around in larger areas that somehow seemed a lot less detailed and a lot less intriguing. It didn't help that **the maps were repetitive, and the school, the dorm, Choe's house just didn't have the same level of surprise as seeing it for the first time**, and I was really wishing there were more new places.

I do realize that this game was done by a different dev team, on a different engine (Unreal 3 vs. Unity). I have a lot of respect for [Dontnod](http://dont-nod.com/en/), the developers of the first Life is Strange, who had some practice with the Unreal Engine, creating Remember Me, and now working on a promising title [Vampyr](http://www.vampyr-game.com/en) that is using Unreal 4. According to Google, Deck Nine has been working on Playstation games prior to Before the Storm, none of which I know anything about as I don't own a PS. But it seems to me they were rather new to a hard task, and I acknowledge that it must have taken tremendous effort to recreate an existing world on another engine and kick it to life. However, it did feel very different and sometimes **oddities like character animation** ruined the scene for me.

Some of the things that were done well in the first game were forced in this, often feeling awkward or unnecessary, like some of the weird shots that were just meant to take the characters' odd animation out of focus, or those episodes when you are just sitting around, daydreaming. It works well in some cases, like when Chloe and Rachel are sitting on the train, listening to music, but for the most part, **it just feels like overusing an element that doesn't seem to play part in the story** whatsoever.

I can't help but compare it to the first game on every level, and to me, the characters felt a lot less developed. Here, **nearly everyone seemed flat, with a simplified personality, and the storytelling often fell into putting them on one end of the good-people-do-good, bad-people-do-bad dimension**. But one exception that needs to be mentioned is definitely Drew, who shows more than one side to his character throughout the game. But since everyone else lacks any 3D characteristics, I didn't have strong feelings about anyone in the sequel - prequel? What happened to the character development of David? What about Frank? Victoria? They seemed bland and Before the Storm didn't add much depth to their personalities.

And let's talk about the story. Is it just me or **is this game completely lacking action**? Do you remember the rails scene where Max has to save Chloe from getting hit by the train? Or when she is in a trippy nightmare maze of her past decisions, trying to sneak around evil Mark Jefferson clones? Or when she is trapped in the Dark Room? To me, these were nerve-wrecking moments, which I didn't have much of in the prequel - sequel? Sure, Before the Storm has a few memorable moments too, like Chloe and Rachel sitting on that train, or the Tempest play. Sometimes I wasn't even sure where the story was going. Was it trying to be about Chloe's father? Or Rachel's mother? About the loss of a parent? Chloe and Rachel love-slash-friendship? As much as Rachel is an adorable character, her out-of-the-blue relationship with Chloe was confusing, and I'm guessing it was going more for the love story than the friendship thing, but who knows, really (if it matters)?

Also as a part of the story, **Frank sometimes appeared to act as Deux Ex, magically steering the storytelling when it was navigating itself into a corner**. I was baffled that we saw Damon waving that knife around twice (!!!), only to be removed from the scene by Frank both times, and letting the scenario resolve itself off screen. The second time it happened, I thought Chloe might still be unconscious, and that chat with Sera might be one of those dream scenes she had with her father. But it turned out to be real, I guess, so Frank just removed Damon from the scene, untied Sera, and left Chloe laying on the floor for some reason... okay? And what the hell was that sudden jealousy fit from Elliot at the Amber house? He totally didn't come across as that type of guy, and it felt more out of character than an actual twist.

<small><b>Chloe as seen in the original Life is Strange</b><br /><em>Steam Community / Kelly</em></small>

At the end of episode three, we are cutting to the scene where Rachel's phone is ringing at a place which looks like the Dark Room from the first game, suggesting that it is the night she died.

My biggest problem with Before the Storm, is that I didn't feel like it added that much to the original setup. I realize that Rachel was keeping her relationship with Frank from Chloe, but we didn't learn anything about it here, not even the slightest hint, unless we interpret Frank's occasional willingness to help them as a sign of affection. Side characters were uninteresting and sometimes disturbingly inconsistent (Elliot, Frank), The whole buildup also led to an awkward conclusion, I think that **the last scene at the mill was one of the weakest points of the plot**. And even after, they make you choose between telling or not telling Rachel the truth, even though none of these have any major consequence, since we are already jumping into the closing cutscene. Rachel's relationship with Nathan Prescott was also very underdescribed.

## Verdict

All in all, I feel like I've been playing a game that looks like Life is Strange, behaves like it, but almost everything that made the first game good, is missing from it. I don't feel like I gained anything, except for maybe destroying Chloe's character, reducing her from a badass to a tryhard. In retrospective, I would have liked it more if certain things about her remained mystery.

I thank Deck Nine for the effort, but I would not recommend playing it. Stick to the first Life is Strange game, and see what Dontnod may come up with in Life is Strange 2, which they are announced to be developing.

Liked:
* Soundtrack.
* Chloe and Rachel interaction.

Disliked:
* Animation.
* Character development (or lack of).
* Usage of Deus Ex Machina to fill plot holes.
* Chloe's personality was weak and sometimes hard to sympathyze with.
* No answers for many questions the first game raised about Rachel.

#### 4/10
