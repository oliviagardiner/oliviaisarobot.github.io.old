This is a story about an event design, which somehow went terribly wrong despite being out in the open, as we all witnessed how corruption, the lack of organization and obvious carelessness can drag down a project that could so easily have been great.

We are in early 2015, and Mexico has suddenly announced that they will not host the 2017 World Aquatics Championships. They moved on to the next candidate host – Hungary. Whenever a sports event as large as a world championship is being held (but even in much smaller ones), it is an early stage requirement that the event has some sort an identity, a design, a memorable logo, on which the hosts can base their marketing campaigns.

But we are not only in 2015, we are also in Hungary, where sadly, instead of using the funds responsibly, the Hungarian Swimmers' Association apparently decided to rush-publish several half-finished (and half-assed) design elements starting mid-2015, and they continue to do so even today. How did this happen? And what was wrong with these designs anyway?

The [Hungarian Swimmers’ Association](http://musz.hu/) was responsible for delivering the design of the world championship’s identity.

<small><b>Their original logo</b></small>

It all goes back to last year, when they introduced the [new mascot](https://dailynewshungary.com/the-2017-budapest-world-aquatics-championships-mascot-is-a-white-zombie-puli/) called Bol-dog (which is derived from the Hungarian term for happy and the English word dog, and is very likely to make every bilingual Hungarian person giggle, simply because it's such a silly pun), which they [had to revoke](https://444.hu/2015/08/12/zokoghat-a-vilagon-korberohogott-ronda-pulink-olyan-csunyan-tagadta-meg-ot-gyarfas) soon, such has been the public outrage against it. It looked stupid and horrifying and was by no means original, since the association has used the exact same animal (a Hungarian shepherd dog breed) as a mascot on [at least two previous occasions](https://vastagbor.atlatszo.hu/2016/03/31/gyarfas-kedvenc-hazi-grafikus-koltoje-tervezte-a-vizes-vilagbajnoksag-plakatjait/). It later turned out that [the mascot was also created for free](http://hvg.hu/sport/20150812_Szenzacios_interjuban_tagadta_meg_Gyarfas), as a “friendly favor”.

In February 2016 they finally announced a [public contest](http://palyazatmenedzser.hu/2016/02/13/palyazat-a-budapesti-vizes-vb-kabalafigurajanak-megtervezesere/) for a mascot - which they should have done to begin with -, or so did a Hungarian contest site’s news feed say. The link goes to the website of FINA, to a dead end at this moment, and there’s no update on the new mascot yet. On their website they are still using the badly done cartoon version of the horror-dog.

The cancellation of the above mentioned mascot only gave us a short relief as the association soon published a poster that managed to put the mascot to shame, to celebrate becoming the host of this international sports event.

<small><b>An official poster of a sports event</b></small>

No, this is not a joke, it was a very official and very bad poster, which looks like someone just pasted the elements randomly, without doing any editing or giving much thought to layout. On top of that, the creator picked a hideous decorative font that was last passable on your elementary school birthday invitations. The logos used are also problematic, the typography in particular (look at the letter spacing). It feels like a time travel back to the 90's and not in a fun way.

But when you'd think it can't get any worse than this, you need to remind yourself that we are still in Hungary. It can always get worse.

As a next step, they picked a [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4IJEsbGiMc) for the world championship. It was written by the Hungarian pop singer-songwriter [Ferenc Demjén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Demj%C3%A9n). No disrespect to the composer, but the music feels like a time travel all the way back to socialism, and the video looks like something an average high school student could put together in Windows Movie Maker, yet it is published on the Hungarian Swimmers’ Association’s official YouTube channel. So, again, this was not meant to be a joke either.

Several sources claim that [the artist wasn’t even paid](index.hu/kultur/zene/2015/06/18/demjen_szerint_atvertek_es_nem_fizettek_ki_oket_a_vizes_himnuszert/) accordingly for the song. What does that make the Hungarian Swimmers' Association? Some kind of thieves with a bad taste perhaps.

Two days ago, [they published several posters on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/uszoszovetseg/posts/998110846924705) about the upcoming championship, designed by the same István Fábián, who created last year’s amateur celebration poster. And they didn't just publish them, they seemed proud.

<small><b>Another horrible poster</b></small>

It doesn’t take a designer the point out the several recurring mistakes in the posters. There are visible cut and paste marks around the logos and the text, the sportsmen are over-sized, badly cut out from their original photos, there are mistakes in the coloring, contrast and photo editing (examine the water editing), and so on. To make it worse, he chose the font Scriptina Pro for the text “Hungarian Swimphony” which, apart from being really out-of-place and a clumsy choice for a text as large as that, is a cheap choice for an international sports event like that.

I feel secondary shame when I imagine that any of this was internationally published.

But why does this all upset me so much? Why do I even care?

The reason I personally find all this outrageous and insulting, is because Hungary is home to several talented and exceptionally creative designers and designer teams, yet they have the nerve to leave the design of an international event to a rank amateur. According to the Swimmers' Association's website, [István Fábián is the art director](http://www.musz.hu/cikk/megtartotta-els%C5%91-%C3%BCl%C3%A9s%C3%A9t-2021-es-vb-szervez%C5%91-bizotts%C3%A1ga) of the 2021 world championship (now 2017), and we can only wonder what kind of a shady inside job this whole thing was.

They owe the public an explanation if not an apology, because I’m as sure as a designer can be, that a skilled professional could have created quality designs for the sports event in the given time frame, and you only need to [browse Behance for a few minutes](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33598275/FINA-WORLD-CHAMPIONSHIP-2017-BUDAPEST) to make sure that is true.

The proper procedure would be announcing a public design contest in which they allow the best of the profession to compete, and pay the winner and maybe a few runner-ups properly for their efforts. This is how you get the best value for your money, when it comes to design. But surely, it's cheaper and easier to give it to someone who has questionable experience in clicking around in Photoshop.

As many sad stories, this one had turned into a happy ending as well. No, the Hungarian Swimmers' Association did not grow a sense of taste or dignity. They did not apologize. But such was the public outrage about this, that they were under pressure to choose a better candidate for the brand design.

Their choice was one particular work that has gained a lot of popularity on the internet thank to the press. It was the one I have linked above, the work of Ferenc Hetsch, which was [modified by Graphasel Design Studio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/59886227/17th-FINA-World-Championships-Budapest-2017-identity), and became the final branding version of the FINA 2017 Swimming World Championship, [complete with signage design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/56832839/17th-FINA-World-Championships-Budapest-Signage-System). I am happy that public disapproval managed to push this project to a better direction, and I encourage you the check out the links above, because they are very detailed and beautifully illustrated documentations of the final design.

Moral of the story? A design project like this represents an entire country. We have a saying in how we present ourselves internationally, and we should push decision makers to actually utilize local talent and resources to create something we can, in the end, all be proud of.
