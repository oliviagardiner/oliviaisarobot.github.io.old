		<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>I am Olivia Gardiner, a full-stack web developer and graphic designer located in Budapest, Hungary. The current languages I'm coding in are Javascript, PHP and python, but I'm not going to lie when I say that Javascript is the one closest to my heart - python coming up as a close second, and as my favorite swiss army knife. I am interested in studying related frameworks, particularly Angular 2 and Vue.js (Nuxt), having already used them in past projects, and my next framework of choice would be most likely React.</p>

		<p>My main focus right now is to expand my knowledge in programming languages I already know, particularly Javascript, in which I am not only interested as a client side scripting language, but also as a server side language, and I would also love to learn more about writing desktop or mobile applications in JS.</p>

		<p>I strive to get better at what I'm doing and I refuse to compromise on code and design quality. I appreciate good project management and a team that cares about coding standards and knowledge sharing. I consider myself an organized person, I enjoy agile development and the use of kanban board even for solo projects.</p>

		<p>I code for the users and not for myself, and I always try to keep that in mind when I design interfaces or workflow, as the best results have been delivered when there was sufficient cooperation not just within the coding team but between departments too.</p>

		<p>My studies and experience in graphic design works well together with coding, having worked on the applied side of design, focusing on usability, funcionality and user experience. In interface design, I appreciate material design and minimalistic designs, pleasant typography and using space bravely. I like elegant and clean designs but I am also a colorful person, hence I like to venture from simplicity from time to time.</p>

		<p>No matter what anyone says, software development is a creative job, and it is often required to think outside the box. Coding is not about reusing and recombining methods that other people came up with, it is just as much about finding your own way to a solution unique to you. I like to look at whatever I do with a critical eye, and try to deliver the best result possible.</p>

		<p>Of course, sometimes we look back a year, two years, go through some of our older work and think <i>"Oh, wow, I can't believe I actually made something as XXXX as that!"</i>. Feel free to substitute any negative adjective: horrible, ugly, messy. But it's a part of learning. If I looked back and saw something that I would do even today, it can possibly mean that I have not improved at all. I am patient and I want to go through the curve of learning.</p>

		<h2>Interests</h2>

		<h3>Books</h3>

		<p>Ever since I remember, I've always been reading something. I think the only longer period that really put me off reading books was during university, simply because of the sheer volume of scientific articles I had to read on a daily basis. I don't miss it.</p>

		<p>My genre of choice is science fiction or fantasy, more often than not, but I am interested in a good many things. My favorite authors are Philip K. Dick and Ray Bradbury, and I have a leftover admiration for Darren Shan from my horror-loving teens. Other authors I could recommend (form very different genres), would be Oliver Sacks, a neurologist who writes about his case studies with great sense of humor, and Andrzej Sapkowski, a Polish writer who, in case you haven't heard, wrote The Witcher series, on which the popular computer games were based.</p>

		<p>I enjoy stories that make me think, make me guess, and also the ones that make me cry. My favorite game to play while reading a book, is trying to guess the plot twists, and I love it when a book manages to surprise me. The best books I've ever read were <i>Do androids dream of electric sheep?</i> (Philip K. Dick), <i>The Master and Margarita</i> (Mihail Bulgakov), <i>The Last Unicorn</i> (Peter S. Beagle) and <i>Life is elsewhere</i> (Milan Kundera).</p>

		<h3>Computer games</h3>

		<p>I don't have many addictions, if any at all, but computers games are probably one. From the moment we first got a shared computer with my brother in my early teens, I've been unable to wriggle free of this spell. A whole new world, a whole new story in every piece of software!</p>

		<p>My favorite kind of games are rpg-ish third person games, mobas, adventure games, platformers. I am not much of an FPS player, but there are still some that I like (Left 4 Dead, Bioshock). I am terribad at strategy games. The games I've spent the most time on are most likely World of Warcraft, Terraria, League of Legends and Diablo.</p>

		<p>If you have no idea about computer games, but wondering what's so good about them, I have a few recommendations for you. One of my old favorites was <i>Fable: The Lost Chapter</i>, a magical game about heros with its fairytale story and enchanted world. If you want to try a visual novel kind of trippy, twisted game with a good soundtrack and immersive story, play <i>Life is Strange</i> (the original, not Before the Storm). Or do you remember those classical car racing games? Why not give <i>Flatout 2</i> a try? Nice soft rock soundtrack, destructible map and car, vehicle upgrades and everything you want. Did I mention funny mini-games? Or if you are the casual mobile-gamer kind, I can recommend <i>Plants vs. zombies</i> (the computer game, not the pay-to-play mobile game), a light-hearted, casual puzzle-game with a good sense of humor. I sometimes review games that I play, <a class="content-link" href="/tag/game">you can find these on my blog</a>.</p>

		<h3>Music</h3>

		<p>Now, this is a long story. I've always liked the odd end of every genre, and I also can't identify with just one musical subculture either. I enjoy rock and metal music, electronic music, synth, alternative and classical. I always discover something new that I like, and there are artists I move on from, over time.</p>

		<p>My favorite kind of music to listen to while I'm coding is chillstep/dubstep, alternative, or sometimes specific artists like <i>The Midnight</i>, <i>Scandroid</i> and <i>Pink Floyd</i>. For gaming, my music of choice is mixed electronic, new retro wave, drum & bass, rock and metal, my favorites being <i>Pendulum</i>, <i>Trivium</i> and <i>Lacuna coil</i>.</p>

		<p>In case you were going to update your playlist, you can see what I'm listening to on <a class="content-link" href="https://bandcamp.com/oliviagardiner" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>!</p>

		<h3>Photography</h3>

		<p>I am but a hobby photographer, I don't claim that I'm great at it, but I enjoy discovering the world through the lenses. I particularly enjoy urban and nature photography and trying to take good shots of my cats.</p>

		<p>As an amateur photographer, I also like visiting photo exhibitions. I don't link selfies, and I don't agree that the reason we have a camera on our cellphone is to share everything about our lives on social media.</p>
